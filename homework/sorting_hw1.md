##Selection Sort
#Show the steps in sorting this list with Selection Sort: (4, 3, 22, 1, 8, 5) *

#Why is selection sort's efficiency independent of the data being sorted? *

#How many passes/scans will go through a list of 10 elements? *

#How many passes (or "scans") will there be through a list being sorted using a selection sort? *

##Insertion Sort
#Show the steps in sorting this list with Insertion Sort: (4, 6, 7, 4, 2, 3, 9) *

#Consider the following lists of partially sorted numbers. The double bars represent the sort marker. How many comparisons and swaps are needed to sort the next number. [1 3 4 8 9 || 5 2] *

#If all the elements in an input array is equal for example {1,1,1,1,1,1}, What would be the running time of the Insertion Algorithm? *

#What operation does the Insertion Sort use to move numbers from the unsorted section to the sorted section of the list? *

##Merge Sort
In the course of a merge sort on a 64 element list, how many times must the list be split? *

#Consider the following pairs of lists: A. (3, 5, 7, 9) and (2, 4, 6, 8) B. (1, 2, 3, 4) and (5, 6, 7, 8) Which pair is more efficiently merged? *

#In general, how many merges will be performed in an n element list (for the sake of simplicity, assume that n is a power of 2)? *

#An array has indices ranging from x to x+n; the merge sort would be applied from c to x+n, where c
