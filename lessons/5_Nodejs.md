### Intro to Node.js

In the tech field the ability to quickly learn and pick up new technology is critical for keeping up and advancing in the field.  In this part of the class we will give a brief intro into node.js and then dive into coding and learning hands on.  This intro will narrowly focus on using the technology to build an API server.  Students will be able to continue this project after this session to build an API server to make data from their app publicly available.

This session will cover:

* Basics of Node.js
* Non-blocking code
* Basics of API design (REST, methods, versioning, etc)
* npm (Node Package Manager)
* express.js (a web server framework)
