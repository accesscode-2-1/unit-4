## Title: Project Swap
Date: September 24th, 2015

###Learning Objectives: 
* Understand a foreign codebase.

* Explain a codebase you are familiar with.

* Implement a small feature of a big project. 

* Learn about developing in a context similar to industry.

* Experience the effects of good and bad code decisions directly. 

###Rules of the Game: 
1. Teams determine a list of features that they would do if they had 3hrs to work on the project (4+ features).

2. Teams are paired up. (BlockOn <-> Equo, Espy <-> Blazon, Chip Chop <-> Access Food, Mozi <-> Momentune)

3. Teams assign features to the members of the other team.

4. Teams explain to each other the overall structure/architecture of their project (30min each at most).

5. Check that everyone has the project running on their environment. 

6. Individuals start working on the feature assigned to them
Each individual has a total of 5 questions to anyone in the other team over the course of the weekend.

7. Teams evaluate the individual performance of each member of the other team.

###If you are struggling to find tasks: 
Look at your to do lists during the project. 

Think of what is missing.

Are there bugs in the system?

###Evaluation: 
Each team will evaluate the performance of the other teamâ€™s members on each task.

When you submit the feature Sunday 27 by midnight, fill out this self evaluation: [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1iXOvwsmwCYNhrRLaDT-_rLg5YE5sKTWJZTAnjfYTKOE/viewform)

By Tuesday 29 before class you must submit evaluations for ALL the features implemented in your project: [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12Qu8Qj6eahF9vtWbG-w9ya2iVu-jIcsbDL_wGk41Hp4/viewform)

You will be evaluated based on:

* Is the feature fully implemented? 

* How well does the code integrate with your project? 

* How independently did the task get done?
